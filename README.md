# Hi there! I'm Abdullah. 

## About me

I'm an aspiring Software Developer.

I enjoy coding because it gives the person the power to overcome challenges and struggles. The reward that a person gets from simplifying problems and find an approach to solve them is satisfying. Being a part of an ever-evolving industry is something that excites me, because that means that there is a lot of new things to learn.
